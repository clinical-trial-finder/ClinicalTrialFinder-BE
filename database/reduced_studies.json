    "summary": "\n      A. Background and purpose:\n\n      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy for unresectable locally\n      advanced colon cancer: an open, multi-centered, randomize controlled phase 3 trial.\n\n      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, the morbidity and mortality\n      rate are both in rising trend. 10-23% newly diagnosed colon cancer is at locally advanced\n      stage and surgically unresectable. For this subgroup, treatment guidelines recommend\n      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy. However, less than 50% patients\n      could convert into R0 resectable, therapeutic effect is unsatisfactory, 5-year overall\n      survival rate is only 12.5%-45.7%.[JCO,2010] Since 2006, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has\n      been a recommendation as standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer, and has been\n      widely applied to clinical use. As for locally advanced colon cancer, it still lacks evidence\n      to support whether neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a beneficial option. There are only\n      several articles about locally advanced colon cancer undertaking neoadjuvant\n      chemoradiotherapy before surgery through Pubmed research, including 3 case reports, 1\n      abstract and 5 clinical researches with a small sample size, 3 of which are from the\n      investigator's study group.\n\n      The investigators recently reported clinical data about therapeutic effect of 60 unresectable\n      locally advanced colon cancer cases and the results were exciting. According to the results,\n      through neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, R0 resection rate is 86%, local recurrence rate is\n      10.2%, 3-year OS and 5-year OS are 76.7% and 66.6%, respectively. [Onco Targets Ther, 2018]\n      \"Colorectal cancer diagnoses and treatment guidelines\" written by Chinses Society of Clinical\n      Oncology (ver. 2017, 2018), suggested that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was an optional\n      treatment strategy or secondary recommended treatment strategy. In a word, the investigators'\n      result was referred as revisory basis of the guideline [CJC,2016], with a relatively low\n      level of evidence in evidence-based medicine.\n\n      This phase 3 clinical trial mainly aims to acquire a higher level of evidence in\n      evidence-based medicine on the subject about neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy as a treatment\n      strategy to unresectable locally advanced colon cancer, and the ultimate goal is to rewrite\n      the International treatment guidelines of locally advanced colorectal cancer.\n\n      B. Research Content:\n\n        1. . Research Object: Patients who newly diagnosed unresectable locally advanced colon\n           cancer. Including: 1. tumor infiltrates through the intestinal wall and adheres to\n           tissues and organs around the colon(T4b), imaging assesses that R0 resection is\n           unachievable. 2. Pericolonic lymph node involvement is closely adjacent to the large\n           abdominal vessels, imaging assesses that lymphadenectomy is difficult. 3. Surgical\n           exploration indicates that R0 resection is not achievable. 4. In initial diagnosis,\n           surgeon evaluates the need for extensive multi-organ combined resection and expected to\n           damage the organs, which would seriously affect the postoperative quality of life.\n\n        2. . Main research indicator: 5-year overall survival rate\n\n        3. . Secondary research indicators: 1. R0 resection rate 2. 3-year tumor-free survival rate\n\n        4. . Research groups assignment: 1. Research group: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy group; 2.\n           Control group: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy group.\n\n        5. .

Based on α=0.05(bilateral), β=0.20(unilateral), 5-year OS improves from\n           45% in control group to 65% in research group, 4-year period, 5-year follow-up. Research\n           group and control group should at least enroll 74 and 75 qualified cases, respectively,\n           a total of 149 cases, with an expected delisting rate of 20%, the total sample size is\n           186, 93 cases for each group.\n\n        6. .

    "summary": "\n      A debate regarding ankle fracture fixation centers on time to weight bearing. Recent\n      literature has supported immediate weight bearing in surgically stabilized ankle fractures.\n      However, significant variation among orthopaedic surgeons persists, and weight bearing\n      recommendations change when there is a syndesmotic disruption. There is very little\n      literature on time to weight bearing, with most available series casting/immobilizing these\n      injuries for 6 weeks after fixation. There is very little data examining post-operative\n      weight bearing after syndesmotic stabilization, and the majority centers on screw fixation.\n      The minimum time to weight bearing after an ankle fracture with syndesmotic fixation in the\n      literature is 4 weeks, with most focusing on 6 to 12 weeks. Based on biomechanical data\n      regarding suture button techniques, the investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing\n      ankle fracture fixation plus suture button fixation of their syndesmotic disruption will be\n      able to safely bear weight early (2 weeks) after surgery. The investigator's null hypothesis\n      is that there will be no difference between early weight bearing (2 weeks), and late weight\n      bearing (6 weeks) in terms of outcome, hardware failure, loss of reduction, and return to\n      work.\n\n      Adult patients who have an ankle fracture with suspected syndesmotic disruption, requiring a\n      suture button fixation operative intervention will be randomized into early (2 weeks\n      post-surgically) weight-bearing status or delayed weight-bearing status (non-weight-bearing\n      for 6 weeks following fixation).\n\n      Primary objective: Maintenance of ankle reduction at 1 year follow-up (measured by comparing\n      immediate post-op CT and 1 year time-point CT).\n\n      Secondary Objectives: Pain scores, surgical experience, work productivity and activity\n      impairment , AAOS foot and ankle scores (2w, 6w, 12w, 6m, 1y), use of assistive devices,\n      range of motion, physical therapy requirement/length of use/compliance, post-operative\n      protocol compliance, post-operative complications (wound healing, infection, implant failure,\n      fracture healing).\n    ",

    "phase": "Phase 2",
    "source": "Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris",
    "summary": "\n      Minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) is an acquired glomerular disease characterized by\n      massive proteinuria occurring in the absence of glomerular inflammatory lesions or\n      immunoglobulin deposits. MCNS represents a frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in\n      adults (10% to 25% of cases). The disease typically takes a chronic course characterized by\n      frequent relapses. Until now, exclusive oral steroid therapy at the dose of 1mg/kg/day (max\n      80 mg/day) for a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 16 weeks (as tolerated) constitutes the\n      first line treatment of adults with MCNS. Despite of successful remission of initial episode,\n      previous case series showed that 56%-76% of patients experience at least one relapse after\n      steroid-induced remission. The recent MSN trial prospectively showed that 57.9% and 70% of\n      adult patients were in complete remission (CR) after 4 and 8 weeks of oral steroids therapy\n      (1mg/kg/day). Among them, 23.1% of patients displayed at least one relapse episode (after one\n      year-follow-up). Although well tolerated, side effects are common in patients with prolonged\n      and/or repeated courses of steroids and alternative regimens seem highly suitable to reduce\n      the risk of subsequent relapse. Rituximab has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic\n      option in patients with steroids dependent-MCNS. In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized,\n      placebo-controlled trial in children with frequent relapse or with steroid dependent NS, the\n      authors found that the median relapse free period was significantly longer in the Rituximab\n      group than in the placebo group without significant differences concerning serious adverse\n      events. To our knowledge, its use has never been investigated for the initial episode of MCNS\n      with the aim to reduce the subsequent risk of relapse that is a major concern in the\n      management of MCNS patients.\n\n      The main objective is to demonstrate, from initial episode of MCNS in adults, once complete\n      remission has occurred, that the use of Rituximab (two injections separated by one week\n      375mg/m2, with definitive steroids withdrawal after 9 weeks of treatment) may reduce the risk\n      of subsequent MCNS relapse after 12 months of follow-up and may be a safe and an efficient\n      treatment regimen compared to the standard regimen of exclusive oral steroid (progressively\n      tapered within 24 weeks) The study will be a single stage phase IIb, randomized, open-label,\n      parallel group, in a 1:1 ratio, active controlled, multicenter trial testing the efficacy and\n      safety of two injections of Rituximab separated by one week 375mg/m2 compared to the standard\n      regimen of oral steroid alone (progressively tapered within 24 weeks) from initial episode of\n      biopsy-proven MCNS in adults. Since Rituximab therapy (when initiated in a context of steroid\n      dependency MCNS) seems to be more effective in patients with complete remission and because\n      of recent data from MSN trial showing that 70% of patients were in complete remission of\n      nephrotic syndrome after 8 weeks of steroids, we decided to maximize the potential benefit,\n      to perform randomization of patients after 8 weeks of steroid treatment. A potential risk\n      factor of relapse is the time of CR occurrence, and because some patients reach CR at 4 weeks\n      and others at 8 weeks, a randomization (1:1) with minimization strategy will be done in order\n      to balance this factor between arms. The primary endpoint will be the incidence of MCNS\n      relapse during the 12 months following randomization defined by the recurrence of nephrotic\n      syndrome (urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 300mg/mmol and decreased albumin level (<\n      30 g/L) in a patient who was in complete remission.\n\n      Rituximab is currently considered as an effective therapeutic option to maintain remission in\n      patients with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) or steroid-dependent nephrotic\n      syndrome (SDNS). The goal of this prospective study is to determine the potential interest of\n      the use of Rituximab from the initial episode of MCNS to reduce the risk of subsequent\n      relapse, that is a major concern in the management of MCNS patients.\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      Surgery for brain gliomas is usually guided by different imaging techniques including\n      neuronavigation MRI and intraoperative ultrasound that do not allow visualization of the\n      low-density peri-lesional tumor infiltration present in gliomas and from which the tumor\n      recurs.\n\n      Another important aspect in the management of glial tumors is the histological grade. The\n      appearance of new vessels (called neo-angiogenesis) is one of the crucial steps in the life\n      of these tumors, which signifies the transition to anaplasia.\n\n      This neoangiogenesis is diagnosed during the anatomopathological analysis of the operative\n      specimen, and may be suspected on preoperative MRI on the so-called infusion sequences.\n\n      The objective of this project is to evaluate the potential of two ultrasound modalities -\n      elastography and ultrasensitive Doppler - in helping the surgical management of brain tumors.\n      Ultrasound elastography measures cerebral elasticity and thus indirectly the degree of tumor\n      infiltration; while ultrasensitive Doppler measures intratumoral vascularization, and could\n      therefore help in the diagnosis of tumor anaplasia.\n    ",

Younger, active\n      individuals often present now to orthopaedic surgeons requiring treatment of knee\n      osteoarthritis. Knee arthroplasty has been offered as a viable option to provide pain relief\n      and improve function in the middle-aged patient.\n\n      In a previous study submitted for publication, the investigators have looked at BMD in vivo\n      after total knee replacement comparing two different tibial base plate designs in cemented\n      and uncemented implants in terms of stiffness and modularity, and its effect on bone density\n      changes, synovitis, osteolysis or survivorship. The investigators found a difference of 18%\n      in bone mineral density favoring trabecular metal implant over cemented modular metal-back\n      implant in patient between 55 and 75 years of age. The trabecular metal implant thus behaved\n      as it was expected and preserved bone density in an elderly population.\n\n      No randomized clinical trial has looked at cemented titanium tibial insert to uncemented\n      trabecular metal tibia insert in young population. In order to isolate stiffness as study\n      variable, one would aim at randomizing a homogeneous patient population undergoing total knee\n      arthroplasty with implants of similar articular geometry designs with different tibial\n      baseplate, titanium versus trabecular metal.

    "summary": "\n      Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), a tumoral tumor of the peritoneum, is a frequent metastatic\n      localization of colorectal cancer (CRC, 13%). Long regarded as a palliative situation, its\n      management has progressed significantly with a curative treatment based on a complete\n      cytoreduction surgery coupled with intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy. However current\n      screening tools, tumor markers (ACE, CA19-9, CA125) and abdominopelvic CT scan are\n      insufficient, to diagnose CP early. A non-invasive biomarker, more sensitive and more\n      specific than currently available tumor markers, would be a major advance in oncology.\n      Microparticles (MPs), vesicles from extracellular membrane budding in response to cell\n      activation or apoptosis of different cell types, have been described as implicated in tumor\n      progression, procoagulant activity associated with cancer, and initiation of metastatic\n      niches. A specific microparticulate (microparticulosome) signature has been reported in\n      patients with CRC, particularly in the presence of a thromboembolic event. However, there is\n      currently no data on PMs and their involvement in CP. In addition, CP and surgery coupled\n      with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy are major risk factors for thromboembolic\n      complications. The characterization of prothrombotic PMs is therefore essential to predict\n      such event.\n\n      The main objective of this project is to characterize the microparticulate signature of CP of\n      colorectal origin and to compare it with that of CP without CP. The secondary objectives are\n      to compare the microparticulate signature obtained on peripheral venous samples and\n      intraoperative tumor samples, evaluate the evolution of the microparticulate signature\n      between the beginning and the end of the intervention, then correlate the peripheral\n      signature to the oncological follow-up of the patients with CP and the occurrence of a\n      thromboembolic event.\n    ",

NOVEOS® uses a quick\n      and convenient method to give results concerning the patient's sensitization profile towards\n      allergens. The volume required for the assays is 4 μl (against more than 100 μl for current\n      techniques), which is particularly important in pediatric and geriatric populations where it\n      may be more difficult to take larger samples.\n\n      NOVEOS® also brings true autonomy.

Liver abscesses are most commonly\n      pyogenic followed by amoebic and rarely tuberculous or fungal in immunocompromised patients.\n      In the developing country amoebic liver abscess is more frequent than the developed country\n      but secondary bacterial infection of amoebic liver abscess and polymicrobial pyogenic liver\n      abscess are also common.\n\n      Pyogenic liver abscess is commonly a polymicrobial infection caused by mixed enteric\n      facultative and anaerobic pathogens. The most commonly isolated organisms are Escherichia\n      coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus anginosus,\n      Streptococcus intermedius, Enterococcus and anaerobes, including Bacteroidesfragilis and\n      Fusobacteriumnecrophorum. Amoebic liver abscess most frequently occur following infection\n      with the parasite Entamoeba histolytica.\n\n      Liver abscess is a common medical emergency. Prompt empirical antimicrobial with or without\n      percutaneous aspiration or drainage of the abscess is therapeutic.\n\n      An empiric antimicrobial regimen for liver abscess should cover enteric gram-negative\n      bacilli, streptococci, anaerobes and antamoebahistolytica. Presently a Fluoroquinolone\n      (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin) or a Third or Fourth generation Cefalosporine (Cefixime,\n      Ceftriaxone, cefepime) or a Beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination\n      (piperacillin-tazobactam or ticarcillin-clavulanate) or a Carbapenem (Imipenem-cilastatin,\n      Meropenem, Doripenem, Ertapenem) are being used in combination with or without Metronidazole\n      as the empirical antimicrobial regime for the treatment live abscess. There is no randomized\n      controlled clinical trial to evaluated and compare efficacy of the antimicrobial regimens for\n      the treatment of liver abscess as well as there is no specific treatment guideline for the\n      use of empirical antibiotics. There is also no definite proven rational for using\n      Cefalosporine, Beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination or Carbapenem upfront, not\n      using Fluoroquinolone in empirical antibiotic regimen for the treatment of liver abscess.\n      Injudicious use of broader spectrum antibiotics may also lead to rise in antibiotic\n      resistance in future.\n\n      Both ciprofloxacin and Cefixime are effective oral antibiotics as they are well-absorbed\n      orally with good oral bioavailability and achieve plasma concentration well above the minimal\n      inhibitory concentrations require for the killing of the microorganism. Using intravenous\n      (IV) antibiotics upfront, for the treatment of liver abscess in patients who can take orally\n      may unnecessary increase the duration of hospital stay, healthcare burden and the cost of\n      therapy, as well as the risk of hospital acquired infection.\n\n      So the investigators have planned this randomized controlled double blind study to evaluate\n      the efficacy of empirical Ciprofloxacin plus Metronidazole and Cefixime plus Metronidazole\n      therapy for the treatment of liver abscess and to compare the outcomes of two different\n      empirical antibiotics regimen.\n    ",

    "phase": null,
    "source": "Chang Gung Memorial Hospital",
    "summary": "\n      Malignant anterior mediastinal tumors essentially include lymphomas and thymomas. The\n      location of mediastinum is anatomically close to several critical organs such as heart, lung,\n      and breasts, which might be affected meaningfully when the mediastinal region is irradiated.\n      There have been quite a few studies investigating long-term toxicities concerning the above\n      critical organs and risks of secondary malignancies related to treatment regimens combining\n      chemotherapy and mediastinal radiotherapy. With the advancement of modern radiotherapy,\n      highly conformal and intensity modulated radiotherapy have become a radiotherapeutic standard\n      in recent years. However, most previous studies analyzed patients treated in the era of 2D\n      techniques rather than conformal 3D plans. Almost inevitably, a large volume of the heart and\n      lung was irradiated via the 2D technique with which substantial dose levels might be given to\n      these organs unavoidably. Certainly long-term radiotherapy related toxicities are\n      significantly associated with the dose and volume irradiating the normal organs at risk.\n      Relying on the techniques of modern conformal radiotherapy and the contemporary strategy of\n      multimodality therapy, the dose and volume irradiating the heart and lung were considerably\n      reduced. Therefore, objective tools including heart echocardiography and lung function test\n      will be utilized in this prospective study to evaluate and monitor mainly the patients\n      diagnosed as malignant lymphoma who are recommended to receive mediastinal radiotherapy in\n      the era of modern treatment strategy and techniques.\n\n      The participants potentially included in the current study are mainly lymphoma patients with\n      mediastinal malignant lymphoma or patients whose radiation therapy field essentially\n      encompasses anterior mediastinum. Patients are prospectively enrolled in this study after\n      physicians' clinical judgement. After signing the consent form, the recruited patient will\n      receive comprehensive pre-radiotherapy evaluations, including cardiac echocardiography,\n      laboratory tests (BNP, and NT-pro BNP), and lung function tests. Participants who are\n      particularly female patients under the age of 45 will receive pre-radiotherapy breast\n      echocardiography. Radiotherapy treatment planning of both photon and proton respectively will\n      be simulated on Eclipse® treatment planning system. Subsequently participants will receive\n      mediastinal RT within one month after being enrolled in the study. Eligible patients should\n      receive standard multidisciplinary treatment as the tumor board at our institute has\n      suggested. Modern radiotherapy techniques comprise all available modalities in our hospital,\n      including photon or proton beams, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, volumetric modulated arc\n      therapy, image-guidance, and breathing control system. The prescription of treatment field\n      designing and dose scheme will comply with our institutional protocols and updated cancer\n      treatment guidelines. Participants will receive longitudinal follow-up examinations at 3, 6,\n      9, 12, 18, 24, 36 months after the start of RT course. Standardized examinations include the\n      above mentioned cardiac echocardiography and relevant tests.\n\n      It is anticipated that long-term mediastinal RT-related late effects are prospectively and\n      longitudinally surveyed through consistent heart examinations and lung function tests.\n      Long-term effects are expected to be lower with using maturely and widely adopted modern RT\n      techniques. Therapeutic and survival outcomes are expected to be satisfactory, achieving the\n      international level in this prospective observational study focusing on mainly lymphoma\n      patients with mediastinal involvement who are suggested and scheduled to receive mediastinal\n      RT as part of the combined modality treatment.\n\n      This study aims to standardize the application of clinical examinations including cardiac\n      echocardiography, lung function tests, and relevant laboratory tests as part of objective\n      tools for monitoring patients' cardiac and pulmonary functions after receiving mediastinal\n      RT. Therefore, it is expected that the risk factors of predisposing patients to develop\n      cardiac toxicities after chemoradiation particularly including mediastinal RT will be\n      explored and identified. In addition objectivity of BNP (or NT-pro BNP) will also be verified\n      in combination with the objective measurement and findings obtained from cardiac\n      echocardiography. It is anticipated that our study would be an important and leading one that\n      integrates radiation oncology, hematology, cardiology, and pulmonology into prospective and\n      longitudinal cardiopulmonary surveillance carried out for mainly malignant lymphoma patients\n      undergoing mediastinal RT in this era of modern chemoradiation.\n    ",

The symptom is multifactorial and\n      associated with many medical conditions and diseases. The symptom is investigated using\n      structural and functional testing of the pelvic floor. Current investigation techniques have\n      poor correlation between symptom severity and investigation results. These techniques are\n      unable to provide prognostic outcomes, resulting in undirected referrals for treatment based\n      on symptoms alone.

The prognosis\n      remains poor with mortality between 40 and 50%. Nowadays, Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS\n      or VA-ECMO) is the referent therapy to restore blood flow in the body when medical treatment\n      is not sufficient. Despite a good blood flow provided by the ECLS, many patients develop a\n      severe hypotension (so called vasoplegia) due to a loss of vascular resistance mainly\n      explained by the inflammatory response to shock and extracorporeal circulation.

    "summary": "\n      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are extremely common. On average, 50% of\n      individuals suffering an ACL injury will develop radiographic osteoarthritis (OA) 10 to 20\n      years after injury. Unfortunately, ACL reconstruction does not prevent risk of future OA.\n\n      Interleukin-1 (IL-1) levels in the human knee joint increase transiently after an ACL injury.\n      In animal experiments, if interleukin-1 levels are increased in the joint, this alone causes\n      arthritis to occur. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is a naturally occurring\n      inhibitor of IL-1. However, in ACL injuries the balance of these two proteins is disturbed\n      transiently after injury, with the effects of IL-1 dominating this balance. In a large animal\n      model of ACL injury, injection of IL-1Ra into the knee joint after ACL injury significantly\n      decreased the amount of arthritis that was later observed.\n\n      Thus, the investigators hypothesize that injection of IL-1 inhibitor (IL-1Ra) into the knee\n      joint of patients suffering recent ACL injury will decrease the incidence of cartilage\n      damage.\n\n      After appropriate IRB approval, a total of 48 active patients will be randomized into one of\n      three treatment groups. Group 1 will receive removal of the knee joint fluid (aspiration of\n      hemarthrosis) using a needle and syringe within 1 week of injury. Following aspiration of the\n      knee joint, an injection of 5 milliliters (mls) of sterile saline (as a placebo control) will\n      be administered. In addition, a second knee aspiration procedure and an injection of 5mls of\n      sterile saline into the injured knee joint will be performed at 10 days post-injury. Group 2\n      will receive aspiration of the knee hemarthrosis as described in group 1 as well as\n      intra-articular administration of 150mg (~5mls) of anakinra (rhIL-1Ra) within 7 days of ACL\n      injury. In addition, a second knee aspiration and injection of 5mls of sterile saline into\n      the injured knee joint will be performed at 10 days post-injury. Group 3 patients will\n      receive aspiration of the knee hemarthrosis and injection of anakinra as described in group 2\n      as well as a second intra-articular knee injection of anakinra (150mg, ~5mls) on post-injury\n      day 10. Thus, all patients in this randomized placebo-controlled trial will undergo two\n      injection procedures prior to surgery.\n\n      Rather than waiting years to observe the sequelae, T1rho MRI technology will be used to\n      compare MRI findings among patients in these 3 treatment groups as well as an uninjured\n      control group. In addition, the investigators will analyze subjects self-reported function\n      and pain scores as well as urinary levels of cartilage breakdown products over time. These\n      MRI, urine and subjective outcome assessments will be obtained prior to surgery and then\n      again at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months post-operatively.\n    ",

Given that poor sleep\n      quality predicts relapse from smoking cessation programs, particularly among\n      socioeconomically disadvantaged adults, sleep deficiencies and irregular timing of sleep may\n      impact smoking craving and withdrawal symptoms over the course of the 24-hour day.\n      Surprisingly, few studies have examined these temporal patterns of smoking and craving, and\n      none with regard to sleep disruption, chronotype or racial disparities.

Studies have been carried out in an attempt to discover\n      the mechanisms that leads to cachexia in order to improve the therapies and the survival of\n      these patients. Some of these studies give the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract,\n      more precisely the intestine, can collaborate with cachexia. Some of these studies suggest\n      that, the intestinal mucosa, due to hypoperfusion, becomes more permeable to some substances,\n      as like endotoxins, being the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) one of them. The circulating LPS can\n      stimulate the increase of tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-alpha) further increasing the\n      inflammation and, consequently, contributing to the worsening of prognosis. The intestinal\n      microbiota is also affected by hypoperfusion, contributing with increase of permeability.

    "summary": "\n      Non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) include several entities ranging from simple\n      steatosis to hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Steatosis, considered benign and the first stage\n      of the disease, is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver. It may in\n      some cases progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by the\n      presence of a marked inflammation with or without fibrosis. NAFLD is the most common liver\n      disease in the world and is particularly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (80% in the\n      diabetic population). While NASH is characterized by a higher prevalence of mortality from a\n      cardiac and hepatic (cirrhosis and cancer) origin, therapeutic resources are almost\n      non-existent.\n\n      RANK (receptor activator of NF-kB) and its ligand RANKL (a member of the TNFalpha family)\n      have emerged in recent years as new players in bone pathophysiology. By binding to its\n      receptor, RANKL induces a number of signaling pathway and in particular the NF-kB pathway\n      (Nuclear factor-kB), a major player in inflammation. Recent literature shows that the role of\n      RANK / RANKL is not confined to the bone but may be involved in the genesis of inflammation\n      in other tissues. It has been shown recently that a high circulating level of RANKL was a\n      risk factor predictor of T2DM. Furthermore, the invalidation of RANK specifically in\n      hepatocytes protects from insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis induced by a high fat diet\n      in mice.\n\n      The aim of our project is to provide a proof of concept that the RANKL / RANK system plays an\n      important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and in the progression of this disease to NASH.\n      The aim of our project is to provide a proof of concept that the RANKL / RANK system plays an\n      important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and in the progression of this disease to NASH.\n\n      The investigator propose to study the RANKL / RANK expression in serum and liver biopsies of\n      type 2 diabetic patients at different stages of NAFLD.\n    ",

Post-operative endophthalmitis is the most feared complication following\n      any endo-ocular surgery. It can be acute, occurring within 6 weeks post-operatively or\n      delayed as after poor healing, or on a glaucoma filtration bubble. Endophthalmitis after\n      cataract surgery is a complication with a low incidence of (0.030 to 0.047%) but which, due\n      to interventions number carried out (830,000 in 2016, in France), appears significant. There\n      are factors that favour endophtalmitis occurrence such as a vitreous exit from eyeball during\n      surgical procedure, poor scar coaptation, premature removal of sutures, etc... They condition\n      emergency care. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential for safeguarding the\n      eye and its function. Therefore, therapeutic management requires endo-ocular sampling in\n      front of any suspicion of endophtalmitis, to be done before any treatment, to carry out\n      microbiological analysis (direct examination on slide, culture, universal and/or targeted\n      PCR, antibiotic susceptibility test). Vitreous puncture is more contributive than anterior\n      chamber puncture, underlining need for these two samples to identify the responsible germ.\n      Once samples have been taken, a broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy introduction must be\n      performed intra-vitreously combined with systemic and local administration. Intravitreal\n      injections allow treatment to be provided at effective concentrations directly at the\n      infection site. On the other hand, toxic risks must be taken into account, especially since\n      the protocol may require multiple intravitreal injections.\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      Mexico has one of the highest prevalence of obesity, reported on 32.4 percent of people over\n      20 years old, according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (ENSANUT) 2012.\n      This implies that 22 million Mexicans have a grade of obesity. According to the ENSANUT 2012,\n      the prevalence of obesity class III is 1.8 percent (1.5 to 2.1) on males and 4.1 percent (3.7\n      to 4.5) on females.\n\n      In 2008, a multidisciplinary clinic focused on treating severe obesity and its related\n      comorbidities was inaugurated at Specialities' Hospital from the National Medical Center\n      21^st century. Currently, the \"Obesity Clinic\" tends to 400 patients, of whom 150 have\n      undergone bariatric surgery (laparoscopic gastric bypass or gastric sleeve), 250 patients are\n      on waiting list and/or preparation for this procedure, and up to 10 first time appointments\n      per month are provided to asses the admission to the clinic. The requirements for admission\n      are: body mass index (BMI) greater than 35 kg/m^2 with a major comorbidity (diabetes,\n      hypertension, dyslipidemia or obstructive sleep apnea syndrome) or obesity class III.\n      According to our previous data the mean age of these patients is 41 years, 46 percent have\n      pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus; 66 percent has hypertension and 33 percent has\n      dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia or both). The management of\n      alterations in the glucose metabolism (prediabetes or diabetes) in this unit is made by\n      dietary treatment supervised by the Nutrition Service of the Obesity Clinic and with the use\n      of metformin at doses of 1,700 mg/day and/or basal insulin (mainly, Neutral Protamine\n      Hagedorn insulin).\n\n      A group of drug products known as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (iSGLT2) has\n      been recently approved for type 2 diabetes treatment. This low-affinity and high capacity\n      transporter is found in the apical part of the epithelium cells in the proximal convoluted\n      tubules (section S1) and it is responsible of 90 percent of the glucose re-absorption\n      (remaining 10 percent is reabsorbed by the SGLT1); therefore, its inhibition induces\n      glycosuria and subsequently reductions in plasmatic glucose. Dapagliflozin is a selective\n      SGLT2 inhibitor than has shown a sustained effect on the reduction of glycated hemoglobin\n      (HbA1c) at 0.4 to 0.8 percent (with initial HbA1c at 7.8 to 8.0 percent). Additionally, due\n      to the induction of glycosuria up to 20 to 85 g/day, it has been calculated that its use\n      induces a caloric deficit at 80 to 340 kcal/day. This has been tested in patients with type 2\n      diabetes in which induces a weight loss of 2 to 3 kg and in combination with metformin even a\n      weight loss up to 5.07 kg (-6.21 to 3.93 kg) without regain (at least for 2 years) as\n      previously demonstrated. Furthermore, dapagliflozin decrease systolic blood pressure at 4 to\n      5 mmHg, increases HDL cholesterol concentrations at 1.8 to 4.4 percent and decreases\n      triglyceride concentration at 2.4 to 6.2 percent. The drug product action is independent of\n      the insulin production at pancreas, consequently, it exists a possibility of using the drug\n      product on patients with prediabetes or even on other types of diabetes. Regarding the\n      adverse effects related to its use, it has been described increase in the risk of\n      genitourinary infections with a low risk for inducing hypoglycemia. Previous studies have\n      demonstrated no kidney damage generation, although it is contraindicated in patients with\n      chronic kidney disease, as well as patients with repeated urinary infections, preexisting\n      fluid and electrolyte imbalance or dehydration risk.\n\n      A previous study that included 182 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with\n      metformin (HbA1c average 7.17 percent) assessed the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg in total\n      weight after 24 weeks compared to placebo. It was found a decrease in weight of 2.08 kg (2.8\n      to 1.31 kg, p<0.001), decrease in waist circumference of 1.52 cm (2.74 to 0.31, p=0.014),\n      decrease in total fat mass assessed with densitometry (DEXA) of 1.48 kg (2.22 to 0.74,\n      p=0.001), decrease of visceral fat mass of 258.4 cm^3 (448.1 to 68.6, p=0.008) and\n      subcutaneous fat of 184.9 cm^3 (359.7 to 10.1, p=0.03). Most of these studies on weight and\n      metabolic control have been performed in patients with obesity class II or I.\n\n      The aim of this study is to assess if dapagliflozin in combination with metformin is at least\n      10 percent more effective for weight reduction in comparison with metformin in patients with\n      prediabetes or type 2 diabetes and obesity grade III.\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective treatment of\n      malignant hematopoietic diseases. However, poor hematopoietic reconstitution including poor\n      graft function (PGF) and prolonged isolated thrombocytopenia (PT), remains a life-threatening\n      complication after allo-HSCT. Especially with the increasing use of haploidentical allo-HSCT\n      (haplo-HSCT) in the past ten years, PGF and PT have become growing obstacles contributing to\n      high morbidity and mortality after allo-HSCT. Due to the limited mechanism studies, the\n      clinical management of PGF and PT is challenging.\n\n      Recent prospective case-control studies reported that the reduced and dysfunctional bone\n      marrow (BM) endothelial cells (ECs) after allo-HSCT are involved in the pathogenesis of PGF\n      and PT. Moreover, in vitro treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could enhance the\n      defective hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function through repairing the dysfunctional BM ECs\n      of PGF and PT patients. The investigators performed a small-scale pilot cohort study and saw\n      encouraging clinical results that oral administration with NAC could partially repair the\n      dysfunctional BM ECs and improve megakaryocytopoiesis in PT patients, which suggests that NAC\n      is a promising drug in PT patients after allo-HSCT. In addition, prior prospective trial of\n      the investigators suggests that BM ECs<0.1% pre-HSCT is the risk factor for occurrence of the\n      PGF and PT two months following allo-HSCT. Previous single-arm clinical cohort studies of the\n      investigators showed that prophylactic use of NAC before allo-HSCT reduced the incidence of\n      poor hematopoietic reconstitution after allo-HSCT in patients with ECs <0.1% pre-HSCT.\n\n      Therefore, the investigators designed the study with acute leukemia patients who will be\n      scheduled to receive haplo-HSCT. The patients who are in the first complete remission at time\n      of haplo-transplant will be enrolled in the study. Exclusive criteria are bronchila asthma\n      and NAC allergy. The enrolled patients were risk-stratified into BM ECs≥0.1% group (low-risk\n      group) and BM ECs<0.1% group (high-risk group). Patients in high-risk group (ECs<0.1%) will\n      be randomized to 1 of 2 arms: (a) NAC 400 mg three times per day from 14 days pre-HSCT to 2\n      months post-HSCT, (b) No-NAC concurrent control according to a 2:1 schedule. The aim of the\n      trail is to assess the effects of NAC for prevention of poor hematopoietic reconstitution in\n      patients with acute leukemia undergoing haplo-HSCT.\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      Laparoscopic surgery can induce hemodynamic pertubations. Pneumoperitoneum, inevitable in\n      laparoscopic surgery, induces increase in intra-abdominal pressure, which can decrease\n      cardiac output. Simultaneously, pneumoperitoneum can stimulate sympathetic system and\n      increase vascular resistance/arterial blood pressure. Patients undergoing laparoscopic\n      surgery may show a normal range of blood pressure during pneumoperitoneum even when the\n      patients are in hypovolemia, and desufflation at the end of main surgical procedure can cause\n      an abrupt hypotension revealing hypovolemia. Therefore, appropriate fluid management is\n      essential for preventing desufflation-induced hypotension in laparoscopic surgery. Recently,\n      dynamic variables are used to predict and guide fluid therapy during controlled ventilation.\n      these variables arise from heart-lung interactions during positive ventilation, which\n      influence left ventricular stroke volume. Several dynamic variables are derived from\n      variations in left ventricular stroke volume (stroke volume variation, SVV), for example\n      pulse pressure variation (PPV), and variations in pulse oximetry plethysmography waveform\n      amplitude (PWV), which have all been shown to predict fluid responsiveness in different\n      clinical and experimental settings. However, there are few evidences regarding which type of\n      dynamic variables can predict desufflation-induced hypotension in laparoscopic surgery.\n      Therefore, this study was designed to assess the predictive abilities of three different type\n      of dynamic variables including PPV, SVV, and PWV for desufflation-induced hypotension in\n      patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery.\n    ",

Affordable home-based treatments can\n      prevent many of these deaths, with success rates over 97.5% if malnutrition is identified\n      early. If identified late, treatment failure rates increase to 16%. Malnutrition programs\n      currently rely on community health volunteers to screen children, which can lead to high\n      costs, low screening coverage, and late identification. Mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) is\n      the preferred community malnutrition screening tool. Training mothers to use MUAC tapes to\n      monitor their child's nutritional status through a short message service (SMS) mobile health\n      system could increase screening coverage and facilitate rapid engagement with nutritional\n      services where necessary. The investigators propose to test the \"Maternal Administered\n      Malnutrition Monitoring System\" (MAMMS) in a randomized controlled trial in Kenya.\n      Participants will be taught to measure their child's MUAC at 6 or 9-month immunization visits\n      and during 6-month follow up the participants will receive a weekly SMS prompting them to\n      measure and send their child's MUAC to a computer system which will alert a health worker\n      when a child with malnutrition is identified.

    "summary": "\n      Rationale: Delirium is associated with prolonged hospitalization, an increased risk of\n      dementia, institutionalization and mortality, as well as increased costs. Early detection of\n      delirium would allow for early treatment and improved patient outcomes, but delirium is often\n      not recognized and treatment is therefore delayed or not applied at all. Additionally,\n      current screening tools are subjective, so an alternative, more objective diagnostic tool for\n      early delirium detection is desired.\n\n      Objective: To investigate the diagnostic performance of the DeltaScan, a CE-certified device\n      to detect delirium using a brief electroencephalography (EEG) recording. A single EEG\n      recording will be obtained from patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and\n      elderly patient admitted to the ward.\n\n      Study design: Cross-sectional, multicenter study.\n\n      Study population: Adult patients admitted to an ICU, and elderly at the ward.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: (1) Delirium as assessed by an adjudication committee of\n      three delirium experts, based on cognitive information that is collected by one experienced\n      investigator in line with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\n      edition, (DSM-5) criteria (2) Delirium Probability as determined by DeltaScan, (3) the\n      proportion of successful DeltaScan measurements, and (4) the repeatability of the DeltaScan\n      measurements.\n\n      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group\n      relatedness: The burden to participants of this study is minimal. EEG recording using the\n      CE-certified DeltaScan will be made using a strip with EEG electrodes that will be mounted to\n      the head using self-adhesive gel. The patient will be visited by an experienced investigator,\n      who collects information in accordance with DSM-5 criteria for delirium. This assessment will\n      be performed once and takes about 10 minutes. Afterwards, the EEG recording will be performed\n      once and takes a maximum of 4 minutes, and all procedures combined will take a maximum of 6-7\n      minutes. Both the EEG recording and the assessment are an add-on to routine care and will be\n      performed within 30 minutes of each other.\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      Persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) and impaired functioning are common among patients\n      undergoing total knee arthroscopy (TKA). Pain that persists beyond the expected period of\n      healing can be devastating to one's sense of well-being. In fact, pain severity is highly\n      correlated with adverse effects on physical functioning. Strong and consistent evidence\n      indicates that patients with high anxiety and/or depressive symptoms (distress) prior to\n      surgery are at risk for PPSP. Veterans are at particularly high risk for post-surgical\n      problems because 80% experience some level of psychological distress prior to surgery and 50%\n      report experiencing pain on a regular basis. Scheduled surgery is a critical juncture with\n      the healthcare system that provides an important opportunity to identify and address these\n      issues. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a trans- diagnostic and evidence-based\n      treatment for depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. Importantly, ACT has been effectively\n      implemented in various treatment-delivery formats, including intensive 1-day group workshops.\n\n      This application proposes a multi-site, double-blind, two-arm, parallel, randomized\n      controlled trial comparing the effects of an ACT intervention to an attention control (AC)\n      intervention in Veterans at-risk for PPSP following TKA. Veterans with high levels of pain\n      and significant distress prior to TKA will be identified as \"at-risk.\" The primary aim of\n      this study is to examine the efficacy of ACT compared to AC on pain and functioning in\n      at-risk Veterans at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months post-TKA. The secondary aim is to examine the\n      effects of ACT, compared to AC, on depressive and anxiety symptoms and on coping skills.\n      Mediation analyses will be conducted to examine whether changes in depression, anxiety, and\n      coping skills have an impact on pain and functioning. Finally, we will explore the impact of\n      the current opioid restrictions on the use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain\n      management strategies following TKA. The current proposal builds on promising results from a\n      R34-funded preliminary study.\n\n      Providing this therapy prior to surgery for people struggling with depressive and anxiety\n      symptoms, for the purpose of preventing PPSP and impaired functioning following surgery, is\n      innovative. It has the potential to change clinical practice from a focus on management of\n      postoperative pain to prevention of chronic pain in at- risk individuals. This project\n      incorporates an interdisciplinary approach to the care of Veterans that attends to major risk\n      factors of postoperative sequelae that significantly impact Veterans' quality of life and\n      healthcare utilization. Thus, it has the potential to translate what is known about effective\n      treatments of distress and chronic pain to prevent poor surgical outcomes. The format is\n      brief and innovative, offering potential for optimal treatment adherence, participant\n      acceptability, and broad deployment to practice settings. Finally, this more concentrated and\n      time-limited approach allows for completion within a short window of time, such as before\n      surgery.\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition characterised by recurrent lung infections,\n      inflammation and progressive lung damage. Patients with CF and advanced lung disease are\n      limited when exercising and performing activities of daily life, due to increased\n      breathlessness and lower oxygen levels.\n\n      Exercise is an important part of treatment in CF, having been shown to slow down the lung\n      disease and improve quality of life. Patients with CF are encouraged to exercise both at home\n      and during hospital admissions, even when the lung disease is advanced. Often, oxygen therapy\n      is used in patients whose oxygen levels are otherwise too low during. This, however, does not\n      improve their breathlessness.\n\n      Recently, a device to deliver air at flows higher than what other device allow has become\n      available. High flow nasal therapy (HFNT) provides patients with air or a blend of air and\n      oxygen at flows up to 60 L/min. HFNT can improve oxygen levels and reduce shortness of breath\n      in many situations both in the acute and chronic setting. HFNT was shown to improve the\n      tolerance to exercise in patients with other respiratory conditions (chronic obstructive\n      pulmonary disease).\n\n      In CF, HFNT is routinely used for patients admitted with acute respiratory failure (inability\n      to maintain adequate oxygenation) with positive results.\n\n      In this study, we aim to understand if HFNT can improve the exercise tolerance in patients\n      with CF and advanced lung disease, by reducing their breathlessness and avoiding the drop in\n      oxygenation observed during simple training.\n\n      We propose a short study to assess if further large clinical trials are feasible and\n      practical, and we will therefore collect preliminary data to have some results to use for\n      planning other studies. All patients who are admitted in the Leeds Regional Adult CF Unit\n      will be considered for participation in the study.\n    ",

Lack of\n      public exposure and direct patient interaction have led to limited knowledge regarding\n      anesthesiology among patients (2, 3). Status of anesthesiologist and anesthesiology in the\n      eyes of public has always been a problem. Recent advancement in the field of anesthesiology\n      has led to progress in surgical techniques and procedures, it is not always given its due\n      share in media(2). Although professional bodies around the world are trying to improve\n      awareness about anesthesiology, patient's knowledge about anesthesiology and anesthesiologist\n      is largely inaccurate (4-6).\n\n      Studies done in developed countries have shown that patients have limited knowledge about\n      role of anesthesiologist outside the operating room (2, 5, 7 ). A study done in India in 2009\n      shows that there was a wide spread ignorance about anesthesiology and role of\n      anesthesiologist in general public(6). A survey done in Pakistan in 1999 showed that only 56%\n      patients identified anesthesiologist as a doctor(4). Another study done in 2004 showed that\n      82% patients knew that anesthesiologist is a doctor but more than fifty percent had no idea\n      about their other responsibilities in the hospital(8).\n\n      In recent past there may be an increase in awareness about anesthesiology because of\n      explosive growth in media and internet (3). Whether this reflects on patient's knowledge\n      needs to be determined. This information is important for establishing good patient doctor\n      relationship and further efforts to educate general public about the importance of\n      anesthesiology and role of anesthesiologist in health care.\n    ",

This is especially important for\n      rare diseases such as scleroderma as organized support services can be limited.\n\n      However, many people with scleroderma do not have access to scleroderma support groups, and\n      many support groups that are initiated are not sustained due to a number of obstacles.\n      Leaders of these support groups play a particularly important role.

Among them, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is\n      an important expression of systemic atherosclerosis. With the progress of the disease,\n      impaired peripheral blood circulation will lead to many symptoms and signs, such as pain,\n      paresthesia, and numbness.\n\n      In past studies show that regular exercise with moderate intensity may help to improve\n      metabolism and hemodynamic characteristics of the individual. In addition, many studies have\n      found that despite substantial organic changes in downstream tissue, exercise training can\n      improve walking ability and aerobic capacity in patients with peripheral arterial disease.\n\n      To enhance exercise capacity in patients with PAD may involve redistribution of blood ﬂow\n      from vascular beds with lower O 2 exchange rates towards exercising ischemic muscles, an\n      increase in nutritive leg muscle blood ﬂow at the expense of regional shunting mechanisms,\n      increased peripheral O 2 use during exercise attributable to more optimal distribution of leg\n      blood ﬂow, and possible increased muscle capillary density and mitochondrial capacity.\n\n      Therefore, we tried to mimic local (leg) ischemic- reperfusion by systemic exercise, or to\n      practice remote preconditioning effect by interval occlusion of the blood vessel in the upper\n      arm which acquired ischemic preconditioning effect, and to improve local blood flow.\n      Furthermore, the hemagglutination performance in PAD patients may also be used as an\n      important indicator of cardiovascular disease.\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      Colorectal cancer (CRC) affects men and women of all racial and ethnic groups and accounts\n      for more than 600,000 deaths per year, globally. Current treatment options may involve\n      surgery, chemotherapy (both adjuvant and neoadjuvant), radiation therapy, and palliative\n      care, each with trade-offs between disease management and patients' quality of life.\n      Unfortunately, significant disparity exists in the quality of care and there is a need for\n      standardization to ensure high-value health care for all patients.\n\n      This study evaluates the introduction of a Value-Based Health Care (VBHC) patient-centered\n      framework in CRC treatments. VBHC is an innovative approach that aims to improve health care\n      by identifying and systematically measuring both medical and patient-reported health care\n      outcomes and costs. By applying sets of disease-specific outcomes measurements, health care\n      providers (HCP) can compare care strategies and make informed choices with regard to\n      optimization of care, necessary investments and possible cost reductions.\n\n      The adoption of a VBHC patient-centered approach may have a significant impact on therapeutic\n      areas constituting a major disease and cost burden for the global health care, such as CRC.\n      It has the potential to improve cancer care planning, monitoring, and management of patients,\n      by promoting better communication and shared decision making by patients and HCP.\n\n      A patient-reported outcome measurement (PROM) is defined as any report about a health\n      condition and its treatment that comes directly from the patient. The use of a tailored\n      pathway including PROMs improve both quality of life (QoL) and survival in cancer patients.\n      Another essential requirement of VBHC approach is the outcome monitoring, to allow HCP\n      accessing to evidence-based, simplified information on the hospital clinical practice and\n      potentially increase health value for both patients and HCP. For patients with CRC, the\n      International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) developed a comprehensive\n      patient-centered outcomes measurement set that could be used in the clinical practice to\n      monitor patients' status.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the introduction of a VBHC approach in CRC\n      treatments, using a validated VBHC set of clinical outcomes and PROMs, to understand which\n      practice would be most effective in achieving patient-centered care. The underlying\n      hypothesis is that a periodic analysis of these outcomes could increase health value for both\n      patients and HCPs.\n    ",

This robust, low-cost device will allow for the individualized treatment\n      of hypothermia with minimal intervention from the clinical staff. In this study, researchers\n      intend to evaluate the efficacy of this incubator at QECH by comparing infants' temperatures\n      before and after treatment, and calculating the proportion of time that the infants remain in\n      a normothermic range after rewarming. During phase I of this study, the infants will be\n      continuously monitored using the IncuBaby temperature sensor and a gold standard temperature\n      monitor for up to 3 days. The accuracy of the IncuBaby temperature sensor will be determined\n      by calculating the difference between the temperatures recorded by the temperature sensor and\n      the commercial patient monitor at each point in time. During phase II of the study, infants\n      in need of thermal care with an incubator will be treated with an IncuBaby device and their\n      temperatures will be continuously monitored by both the temperature sensor of the IncuBaby\n      device and a commercially available patient monitor.

We urgently need an intervention that prevents NLUTD before irreversible\n      damage occurs. Neuromodulation procedures are a promising avenue so that we investigate the\n      effect of transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS) in patients with acute SCI.\n\n      This nationwide randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind multicentre clinical trial includes\n      all SCI centres in Switzerland (Basel, Nottwil, Sion, Zürich). Patients are randomly assigned\n      to VERUM TTNS (active stimulation, n=57) and SHAM stimulation (n=57) groups in a 1:1\n      allocation using computer-generated permuted block randomisation lists stratified on study\n      centre and lower extremity motor score. Daily 30-minute sessions are performed five times a\n      week during an intervention period of 6-9 weeks. The primary outcome of this study is the\n      success of TTNS to prevent neurogenic DO jeopardizing the upper urinary tract, assessed by\n      urodynamics at 1 year after SCI or any earlier time point if DO treatment is necessary (study\n      end). Secondary outcome measures are bladder diary parameters, clinical symptom scores\n      assessed by standardized and validated questionnaires. Furthermore, neurophysiological and\n      neuroimaging outcome measures are assessed as well as, biochemical and molecular changes.\n      Tertiary outcome measure is the safety of TTNS.\n\n      Before the actual start of the TASCI RCT, start-up activities will include a piloting phase\n      on groups of healthy volunteers and patients. The goal during this phase is to evaluate the\n      feasibility of the experimental setup, in particular for the TTNS and SHAM intervention, but\n      also to test the setup of the different pre and post assessments (e.g. neurophysiology and\n      neuroimaging tests).

    "summary": "\n      Sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate (SPMC) is generally better tolerated than PEG, its\n      cleansing effect remains uncertain. While most studies showed SPMC was non-inferior to PEG,\n      some studies reported that SPMC was less effective than PEG. To improve the bowel cleansing\n      effect of SPMC, splitting the dose by using one sachet the evening before colonoscopy and the\n      other sachet 4 to 5 hours before colonoscopy in the morning, has been proposed.Adding\n      bisacodyl to the regimen also has been shown to be helpful. Some side effects, such as\n      hyponatremia, dehydration and sleep disturbance, were reported to be more commonly associated\n      with SPMC than with PEG.\n\n      To enhance the efficacy and reduce the side effects, two studies have evaluated the\n      combination of SPMC and PEG, with conflicting results.The effect of combining PEG and SPMC\n      should be best appreciated with head-to-head comparison with PEG and SPMC alone at the same\n      time.\n\n      Therefore we designed this head-to-head comparison study for 2 L PEG, 1L PEG plus one sachet\n      of SPMC and 2 sachet of SPMC, all with split-dose and the addition of 10 ml bisacodyl. Our\n      hypothesis is the bowel cleansing effect of the combination regimen was not inferior to PEG\n      alone. The tolerability, acceptability and side effects of the 3 regimen will also be\n      evaluated.\n\n      Patients will be randomly assigned to either PEG, PEG plus SPMC or SPMC group, in a 1:1:1\n      ratio using a computer-generated sequence. The treatment allocation will be concealed and\n      revealed by non-research medical personnel at the screening visit.\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      Avascular necrosis of the talus is a difficult problem to manage, especially in the young and\n      healthy. The only option, historically, has been a talectomy and hindfoot fusion. While this\n      is a viable option, it is not without its morbidity. Arthritis of surrounding joints is\n      common, occurring anywhere from 1-10 years after the procedure. This is especially true in\n      younger patients, where loss of motion can be life altering both physically and mentally. The\n      search for alternatives has been limited. Recently, 3D printing has become more ubiquitous\n      and affordable and newer medical alternatives have arisen thanks to this technology. The 3D\n      custom talus is relatively new in the orthopaedic community, but has been used at several\n      centers with good success. It has been shown to re-establish the normal alignment of the\n      foot, preserve motion (with some achieving almost physiologic motion), and allow for almost\n      normal ambulation. However, the data is still limited and further study is necessary. Our\n      facility was recently approved to perform this procedure. Our hypothesis is that custom 3D\n      printed talar body replacements, either used alone or with total ankle replacements, will\n      maintain physiologic motion, have no difference in complications when compared to hindfoot\n      fusions with allograft, lead to good outcome scores and patient satisfaction scores. Patients\n      diagnosed with avascular necrosis of the talus who agree to undergo a procedure involving a\n      3D custom talus (talar replacement, total ankle/total talus, etc) will be enrolled in the\n      study. Patients will follow standard post-operative protocols and return to clinic at\n      designated time periods (2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year). X-ray evaluation,\n      Range of motion, return to ambulation, walking speed and patient reported outcomes will be\n      evaluated at each visit. Data will then be compared with baseline measurements and use to\n      determine the progression of patients over time after the procedure\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      Prenatal diagnosis of genetic diseases is a real medical challenge. The discovery of\n      antenatal abnormalities on ultrasound is frequent (5 to 10% of pregnancies), and when an\n      abnormalities is seen on ultrasound, it raises the possibility of an underlying developmental\n      anomaly. Currently, in France, when abnormalities are discovered with an ultrasound scan, the\n      etiological diagnosis is based on additional imaging tests (cerebral MRI, 3D bone tomography,\n      fetal CT, fetal CT) or diagnostic tests such as invasive chorionic villus sampling,\n      amniocentesis or fetal blood for infectious, metabolic, immunological and genetic\n      investigations (standard karyotype, FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) for the rapid\n      detection of aneuploidy, Chromosome Analysis on DNA Chip (ACPA or CGH-array) and possible\n      sequencing of targeted genes when they are available within a time frame compatible with\n      pregnancy). NIPT (Non-invasive prenatal testing) on cell free fetal DNA circulating in\n      maternal blood has more limited indications, allowing, from an early stage of pregnancy, the\n      determination of fetal sex and fetal rhesus factor and the search for aneuploidy.\n\n      However, establishing an etiological diagnosis during pregnancy has many benefits for the\n      parents: clarifying the cause, obtaining a more precise prognosis to determine future\n      management and outcome of the pregnancy, and establishing the risks of recurrence.\n\n      Over the past decade, medical genetics has undergone a real technological revolution, leading\n      to the development of high throughput genome-wide, exome (ES) and genome (GS) sequencing.\n      However, few countries have currently embarked on ES/GS in prenatal care, due to the\n      constraints of time and the difficulty of interpreting genomic data when the clinical data is\n      limited to antenatal imaging data.\n\n      In 2016, France launched the France Medicine Genomics 2025 Plan (PFMG2025) to deploy GS,\n      particularly in the diagnosis of rare diseases. It is thus becoming essential to define the\n      modalities of prescription of this testing, in particular during prenatal diagnosis. In\n      parallel, from the first publications, the applications of genomic analysis on circulating\n      fetal DNA seem to be able to extend to genome sequencing for research of SNVs responsible for\n      developmental diseases.\n\n      The AnDDI-rares health network therefore proposes this ANDDI-PRENATOME pilot project to study\n      the feasibility of a \"rapid\" analysis of ES in prenatal diagnosis from 61 fetuses with\n      ultrasound abnormalities, as a first step before considering future cost-effectiveness (PRME)\n      or care system performance (PREPS) studies in conjunction with the PFMG2025.\n    ",

Insufficient sleep is a significant public health issue, with 69% of adolescents\n      in America obtaining less than the minimum requirement of 8 hours of sleep per night. Early\n      school start times has been identified as the most significant and modifiable factor that\n      restricts sleep duration in adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended in\n      2014 that all middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m., yet few school\n      districts have implemented this change. In fall 2017, the Cherry Creek School District, a\n      diverse district of almost 55,000 students outside Denver, changed school start times.\n      Although previous studies have shown increased sleep duration, decreased daytime sleepiness,\n      and improved academics following start time changes for secondary students, there remains an\n      urgent need to understand how this policy impacts health and well-being for all students,\n      including youth in elementary school.

    "summary": "\n      Anaphylaxis elicited by accidental intake of the offending food constitutes a major health\n      risk to the food allergic patient. Current advice for the food allergic patient is to avoid\n      the offending food allergen and to carry an epinephrine autoinjector. However, novel\n      treatments altering the clinical reactivity to the offending food thereby diminishing the\n      risk of anaphylaxis are much needed. A correlation between the level of specific IgE in serum\n      towards the offending food and the clinical sensitivity of the patient has been suggested.\n      The clinical threshold for a food allergic reaction to occur is therefore hypothesized to\n      increase by reducing the level of specific IgE to the relevant food allergen.\n\n      Therapy with Omalizumab has proven efficacious in lowering the level of IgE in serum but a\n      high pre-treatment level of total IgE in serum potentially hampers the efficacy in a number\n      of patients, as seen especially in patients with concomitant atopic dermatitis. The aim of\n      this study is to investigate if the combination of initial IgE specific immunoadsorption\n      combined with subsequent treatment with Omalizumab will increase the clinical threshold to\n      the culprit food and thus prevent medical emergencies (anaphylaxis) in patients with severe\n      food allergy.\n    ",

The\n      modified Seattle Criteria define VOD/SOS diagnosis is made when two of the following three\n      criteria are present in a patient within 21 days of transplantation: hyperbilirubinemia\n      (total serum bilirubin > 2 mg/dL), hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant liver pain, and\n      weight gain (> 2% of baseline) or ascites.

The long-term goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of\n      malaria camps (MCs) by determining if they reduce malaria, and to characterize malaria\n      transmission in MCs. The major objective to achieve this is through a hybrid cluster\n      randomized effectiveness trial, to determine if MCs reduce the prevalence of clinical and\n      asymptomatic malaria as detected by PCR. Villages will be randomized across three study arms:\n      arm 1 to receive new MCs; arm 2 is a control with no MCs but with standard malaria control;\n      and arm 3 consists of villages already in receipt of MCs to study longer term effects.

Appropriate management of these secondary conditions, through a\n      multidisciplinary approach, is imperative as they have been shown to contribute to slower\n      recovery, increased negative outcomes, and greater rates of rehospitalizations and health\n      care utilization. However, resource limitations can restrict the ability of service providers\n      to deliver these integrative biopsychosocial approaches in the community. Guided internet\n      delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) program offers an alternative approach for\n      psychosocial service delivery in the community. The program provides online structured\n      self-help modules based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in\n      combination with guidance from a coach through weekly emails and telephone calls. ICBT was\n      shown to have similar effects to face-to-face CBT. Results from the investigator's pilot\n      pre-post study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03457714), found significant effects of guided ICBT on\n      primary outcome of depression (d=1.20, p=.02) post-intervention and gains were maintained at\n      3-month follow-up among persons with SCI. Significant improvements in secondary outcomes\n      including pain interference, resilience, positive affect, self-efficacy, ability to\n      participate, and grief were also found.These studies demonstrate that guided ICBT is a safe\n      and effective alternative to face-to-face interventions and it may be beneficial for\n      underserviced populations.\n\n      In the proposed trial, the investigators will examine the efficacy of the Guided ICBT Chronic\n      Conditions Course for persons with SCI versus an online SCI Rehabilitation Education program.\n      All participants will complete questionnaires prior to the start of the program, before each\n      lesson of the program, once they have completed the program, and 3 months after completing\n      the program.

Moreover,\n      a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying PNS would allow a more precise\n      identification of the modalities that permit PNS patients to have a better oncological\n      prognosis than cancer patient without PNS, with obvious repercussions in clinical oncology.\n\n      To this effect, an extremely innovative approach involves directly exploring the tumoral\n      tissue of patients suffering from specific PNS via genomic and transcriptomic analysis.\n\n      The study team hypothesizes that antigen ectopic expression by tumour cells may contribute to\n      the generation of PNS.\n\n      In the present study, the investigators will analyze the salient features of tumors\n      associated with PNS, namely the histological and immune cells infiltrate characteristics,\n      their transcriptomic profile, and mutational status of involved antigens.\n    ",

If this happens, people may not be aware of anything on one\n      side, usually the same side they also lost their movement (the most affected side). This\n      severe condition is called spatial neglect. Currently there is no recommended diagnostic test\n      or clinically-proven treatment for the condition. In a recent study, the investigators found\n      a long-lasting reduction in neglect if people practiced picking-up an object with their\n      unaffected hand. This intervention is called Spatial Inattention Grasping Home-based Therapy\n      (SIGHT). It requires people to lift wooden rods of different lengths. Once a person is\n      familiar with the task, they can practice on their own at a time convenient to them in their\n      homes. The investigators have developed the first computerized version of SIGHT (c-SIGHT) as\n      well as a novel diagnostic test for neglect using portable low-cost motion-tracking\n      technology that can be used in the patient's home. In the proposed study, the investigators\n      will investigate how usable and acceptable this technology is in people's homes.

    "summary": "\n      Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a condition resulting in varying degrees\n      of nasal congestion, nasal secretion, facial pain and reduced or absent sense of smell. In\n      Denmark an estimated 200.000 patients suffer from this condition. It affects the quality of\n      life in a degree equivalent to chronic cardiac and respiratory conditions.\n\n      CRSwNP is known to be associated with inflammation in the nose and sinuses. In some patients\n      the inflammation is also present in the lower airway resulting in shortness of breath, chest\n      constriction, wheezing and coughing. It follows that asthma is often seen in patients with\n      CRSwNP.\n\n      Even though the association of asthma and CRSwNP is well known it is easy to overlook the\n      asthma further reducing the quality of life. Previous studies have found that undiagnosed\n      asthma is present in about a quarter of patients with CRSwNP. While many of the CRSwNP\n      patients are treated in private ENT practice alone the lack of simple diagnostic tests giving\n      a reliable measurement of airway inflammation is a challenge in diagnosing concurrent asthma.\n\n      A recent study showed measuring of fractional exhaled nitrogen oxide (FeNO) in exhaled air to\n      be a promising diagnostic test. The concentration of this gas in the exhaled air from the\n      nose and mouth is related to the degree of airway inflammation and can therefore be used as a\n      surrogate measurement in a safe and easy way.\n\n      With this study the investigators want to measure the concentration of FeNO in patients with\n      CRSwNP in private ENT practices. The aim is to explore if it can be used as a screening test\n      for asthma. The study will also screen the patients for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).\n\n      Patients will be recruited from three private ENT practices in the Capital Region of Denmark.\n\n      Patients with CRSwNP will be recruited from their appointments in the ENT clinics. They will\n      be offered inclusion in the study, and if they give an informed consent, an exhaled NO test\n      and a thorough ENT examination including a fiberoptic examination of the upper airway will be\n      performed. They will also be asked to fill out questionnaires on the severity of symptoms\n      from the nose and lungs, sleep quality and their health in general. Patients will also\n      undergo a sleep study (Cardio-Respiratory Monitoring = CRM) and tests of lung function. With\n      signs of respiratory or sinus disease they will be referred for further investigations and\n      treatment.\n    ",

Of\n      these, osteosarcoma (OSS) is the most commonly diagnosed primary malignant bone tumor. OSS is\n      a primary mesenchymal malignant tumor of bone characterized by the production of osteoid or\n      immature bone by the malignant cells. Despite its rarity, OSS is the most common primary\n      malignancy of bone in children and adolescents, and the fifth most common malignancy among\n      adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 19 years.\n\n      Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most frequent bone tumors in children and may arise also in\n      soft tissues. This disease encompasses tumors formerly known as Askin's tumor, Peripheral\n      Neuroectodermal Tumor (PNET) and the Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT).\n\n      Chondrosarcoma are rare sarcoma reputed chemorefractory in the non-operable setting and for\n      which little is known in terms of palliative management with systemic treatments.\n\n      Despite adequate loco-regional treatment, up to 40% of patients with sarcoma, soft tissue or\n      bone, will develop metastatic disease. When metastases are detected, the standard of care is\n      based on palliative chemotherapy with a median survival in this setting of only 18 months.\n\n      A slight improvement has been obtained over years thank to registration of a couple of drugs\n      such as Trabectedin and Pazopanib, the first antiangiogenic registered for soft tissue\n      sarcoma patients. Pazopanib is routinely prescribed worldwide after failure of first line\n      chemotherapy in soft tissue sarcoma. However, bone tumors have not benefited from these small\n      advances yet and treatment still rely on chemotherapy combining doxorubicine cisplatinum and\n      ifosfamide. There is no standard in relapse and palliative settings, and after failure of\n      these agents the survival is very poor. Bone sarcomas are therefore tumors with very little\n      available data and low level of evidence on palliative systemic treatments in clinical trials\n      and in the real life setting.\n\n      The primary objective of the METABONE study is to conduct a retrospective descriptive\n      analysis of clinic-biological profiles, patterns of care and modalities of treatment for a\n      set of patients with malignant bone tumors in a real-life national setting.\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      1.Melasma is a common acquired condition of symmetric hyperpigmentation, typically occurring\n      on the face, with higher prevalence in females and darker skin types. Treatments for melasma\n      include topical, oral, procedural, and combination treatments.\n\n      2.1064-nm Q-Switched laser is one of the most widely used lasers for pigmented diseases in\n      recent years. This wavelength laser can be effectively absorbed by pigment, which leads to\n      damage of pigment and melanocyte. Previous 1064-nm Q-Switched laser treatment of melasma\n      requires the use of large flare and low energy scanning repeatedly in the lesion area, and\n      the terminal reaction is reddish and skin lesion temperature increased by 2℃. So the course\n      of treatment is even longer and is closely related to the treatment of the doctor's\n      subjective judgment. Current 1064-nm Q-Switched fractional laser is designed with focusing\n      lens and can be scanned only once for skin lesions during treatment. Further more, the\n      treatment energy of a single point is higher and it has stronger ability to destroy melanin.\n      Finally, 1064-nm Q-Switched fractional laser promotes the expulsion of melanin particles from\n      the superficial dermis and basal epidermis.\n\n      3.Tranexamic acid (TA) works by inhibiting the plasmin-plasminogen pathway. Increase in\n      plasmin in keratinocytes leads to increase in production of arachidonic acid and\n      alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) production. Thus, by inhibiting the plasmin\n      pathway, TA results in decreased melanogenesis. Studies support the use of oral TA as an\n      adjuvant therapy for in refractory cases of melasma or as a second-line or third-line agent,\n      and there is some early evidence supporting the utility of oral TA as monotherapy. Overall,\n      randomized controlled trials have found that combination treatment regimens using oral TA as\n      adjunct therapy results in greater reduction of melasma.\n    ",

It has revealed benefits of decreased morbidity, earlier\n      discharged, and quicker return to normal daily activities, and shorter hospital when compared\n      to abdominal approach.\n\n      Postoperative ileus (POI) defined as an uncomplicated ileus occurring following surgery,\n      resolving spontaneously within 2 to 3 days. Clinically, it is characterized by abdominal\n      distension, a lack of bowel sounds, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and lack of flatus. It\n      leads to morbidity and delays in patient discharge from the hospital, leading to an increased\n      economic burden on the healthcare system. That's why many researchers have focused on the\n      prevent of postoperative ileus; many studies have investigated preventive approaches such as\n      early mobilization of the patient, adequate pain control, epidural anaesthesia, hot pack\n      therapy, motility agents such as metoclopramide, and alvimopan.

Currently, 1 in 9 adults over the age of 65 have AD, which\n      currently totals more than 5 million Americans and this number is expected to rise as high as\n      16 million by 2050.\n\n      MCI is a clinical syndrome that represents the gray area between healthy aging and dementia.\n      Those with amnestic MCI (aMCI) have memory problems more severe than normal for their age and\n      education, but their symptoms are not as severe as those of people with AD. Patients with\n      aMCI are at high risk for AD. Notably, roughly half of those with MCI will continue to\n      progress and convert to clinical dementia within 3 years. Alternatively, it is also\n      worthwhile to study cognitively healthy older adults who carry genes that may increase the\n      risk of AD. The frequency of the human APOE gene ε4 allele increases in patients with AD and\n      the ε4 allele is also associated with an earlier age of disease onset.\n\n      Currently, there are no known therapies that can effectively modify the progression and\n      hallmark symptoms of AD. Therefore, it is crucial to provide an early intervention in\n      patients with aMCI to delay or prevent the progression to AD.\n\n      More specifically, this project has two specific aims:\n\n        1. To plan personalized non-invasive brain stimulation location by brain Imaging with\n           Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy older\n           adults.\n\n        2. To identify potential personalized cognitive enhancement strategy (such as dosage or\n           patterns) of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in MCI and healthy older adults.\n\n      Techniques to artificially and precisely stimulate brain tissue are increasingly recognized\n      as valuable tools both in clinical practice and in cognitive neuroscience studies among\n      healthy individuals and people with clinical conditions. With these practices, researchers\n      can safely stimulate specific regions of the brain to explore causal relationships that\n      comprise the brain's circuitry and modulate behavior.\n    ",

For children experiencing an asthma exacerbation, emergency department\n      (ED) guidelines recommend early systemic corticosteroid (CS) administration, since studies\n      have shown associated, time-sensitive, decreases in hospital admissions and ED length-of-stay\n      (LOS). For patients who are treated by 911 emergency medical services (EMS) first, there\n      exists an opportunity for even earlier administration of CS, prior to ED arrival. Yet,\n      preliminary data demonstrate that currently less than 10% of EMS pediatric asthma patients\n      receive CS prior to ED arrival.\n\n      Given the known time-sensitivity of CS' effects on patient outcomes, the investigators\n      hypothesize that even earlier EMS administration of CS will decrease hospital admissions, ED\n      LOS, and intensive care unit admissions for pediatric patients with an acute asthma\n      exacerbation. Using a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, this study\n      will fill a significant knowledge gap in the EMS care of pediatric asthma.

    "summary": "\n      Previous studies have reported that the 5-HT2C receptor agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine\n      (mCPP) decreases appetite and food intake in humans1-3. 5-HT2C receptor activation inhibits\n      dopamine and norepinephrine release in the brain4, and has also been linked to diabetes5. The\n      specificity of the effect of mCPP on human appetite is unclear, as previous studies also\n      reported an increase in nausea1,3. The drug has also been reported to increase anxiety and\n      cause panic attacks when given in a bolus dose intravenously6. Previous findings in our\n      laboratory showed that mCPP reduced appetite, increased satiety in women and enhanced memory\n      in the P1vital® Oxford Emotional Test Battery3. Following up on these results a food intake\n      and fMRI study was performed, in which it was observed that mCPP decreased intake of a\n      palatable snack (hedonic eating) and dlPFC and insula BOLD responses to food pictures.\n      Additionally it increased memory and food value responses in brain after mCPP administration\n      (Thomas et al submitted).\n\n      It is well established that eating behaviour is affected by metabolic signals (e.g. insulin,\n      ghrelin, serotonin) and is also modulated via food reward processes7. More recently it has\n      been proposed that eating is also modulated via higher cognitive processes such as inhibitory\n      control, attention, and memory. However, in humans, eating behaviour seems to be a more\n      complex process, which involves habits, long-term goals and social interaction. Thus,\n      cognitive processes appear to play an important role in food consumption. In the proposed\n      study the researchers investigate the effect of administering mCPP, on eating, and on\n      metabolic, reward and cognitive processes and the potential interplay between these\n      functions.\n    ",

    "summary": "\n      Increasing evidence suggests that non-communicable diseases such as in particular obesity and\n      its associated metabolic diseases are inherited from parents to children throughout several\n      generations by epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, this environmental stress would induce epigenetic\n      modification in the germ line that once transmitted and maintained in the progeny would\n      induce the development of the parental pathologies. Considering the increasing prevalence of\n      these pathologies worldwide, we urgently need to understand this process in human. Based on\n      published and unpublished data demonstrating that sperm RNAs are vectors of epigenetic\n      inheritance of obesity mouse model, the investigative team hypothesizes that epitranscriptome\n      of obese men play a central role in the paternal epigenetic inheritance of obesity and its\n      associated metabolic diseases as epigenetic vectors in this process.\n\n      To validate this hypothesis, the investigative team will use sperm from non-obese and obese\n      men taken before and after surgery weight loss. Thanks to these cohorts, they propose to: (i)\n      compare the epitranscriptome profiles of non-obese and obese men to identify the RNAs\n      molecules which will be either qualitatively or quantitatively epigenetically modulated by\n      obesity; (ii) compare the epitranscriptome profiles of obese men before and after\n      surgery-weight loss to assess the reversibility of the newly acquired RNA modifications.\n\n      Giving some answers to this central question will provide not only some clues about the\n      molecular mechanisms involved in this process, elements which might be crucial to stop the\n      spread of this disorder, but will also allow the identification of obese-susceptibility loci\n      which expression may be modulate by environmental factors and consequently able to transmit\n      the disease.\n    ",

The causes of urinary incontinence and its treatment options vary widely. A\n      commonly encountered reason for urinary incontinence in men is related to treatment for\n      prostate cancer.

Mild cases of incontinence are responsive to more conservative\n      measures, but moderate to severe cases often require placement of an artificial urinary\n      sphincter. Typically, these devices are left deactivated for a period of 4- 6 weeks following\n      implantation to allow swelling to subside before use.

There is evidence that conservative\n      approaches should be the first treatment option. Conservative treatment usually addresses a\n      variety of therapeutic behaviors without providing scientific arguments for the choice and\n      progression of exercises. At that, there is a gap in the literature on the best exercises for\n      this population, whether they are exercises to strengthen the remaining fibers of the rotator\n      cuff or exercises focused on strengthening other shoulder muscles with rotator cuff unload\n      exercise program. Objective: To compare the effects of two different exercise programs based\n      on the load of the rotator cuff on a population with shoulder pain and full-thickness tear of\n      the supraspinatus tendon. Methods: This is a controlled, randomized, blinded clinical trial.\n      In this study 78 individuals with shoulder pain and presence of atraumatic rupture and full\n      thickness of the supraspinatus muscle tendon will participate and will be randomly\n      distributed between two groups.

    "summary": "\n      The patient's compliance to his medication therapy, and therefore the success of the\n      treatment, is particularly related to his pharmacy management. Thus, the satisfaction of an\n      individual in their interview with the pharmacist is a very important element.\n\n      The pharmacist in his professional activity may have to manage patients with opioid related\n      disorders. Pharmacist activity will result in the dispensing of opioid replacement therapy\n      (ORT), single-use syringes, harm reduction kits and prevention advices for the reduction of\n      toxicity and infection risks.\n\n      Since the 1990s, the consumption of ORT has been steadily increasing. According to the OFDT\n      (French Observatory of Drugs and Drug Addiction), the number of patients undergoing ORT is\n      about 150 000 patients. Since high-dose buprenorphine is prescribed for approximately\n      two-thirds of patients, it remains the most frequently prescribed ORT in France.\n\n      Recently, a French association assisting drug users (ASUD - Auto-support des usagers de\n      drogues) performed a study in Paris (20/07/2018 - 25/08/2018) to assess the delivery of\n      opioid replacement therapies by community pharmacists. In this study, 71% of pharmacists\n      refused to deliver opioid replacement therapies. The main reasons reported were security\n      (56%) and activity saturation, meaning that pharmacists considered that they had too many\n      patients using opioid drugs. In France, the refusal of a pharmacist to deliver drugs is a\n      punishable offence. According to the Code of ethics of pharmacists, pharmacists must respect\n      life and people without discrimination. Pharmacists have a low perception of patients\n      suffering from opioid addiction. Another study performed by ASUD in 93 community pharmacies,\n      showed that pharmacists used the term \"toxicomaniacs\" instead of \"drug users\". Most\n      pharmacists had had a bad experience with drugs users, with physical and verbal aggressions.\n      The conclusions of this study showed that pharmacists lacked knowledge of drug users and drug\n      use. Pharmacists knew about harm reduction kits for opioid users (containing sterile\n      syringes, needles, water, antiseptics, etc.) and had already opened them, but very few knew\n      how to use them. More worryingly, some pharmacists did not understand the harm reduction\n      strategies available It thus appears that community pharmacists have a difficult relationship\n      with patient suffering of opioid related disorders, which can have an impact on patient's\n      satisfaction.\n\n      The objective of this study will be to assess the satisfaction of patients undergoing ORT\n      regarding their management by community pharmacists.\n    ",

The contents of these\n      subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) include difficulty retrieving specific words (e.g.,\n      names of people or places), misplacing common items (e.g., keys or eyeglasses), and\n      prospective memory failures (e.g., forgetting appointments and reasons for entering a room).\n      One study found that 54% of people in a sample composed of 15,000 adults over the age of 55\n      reported that they had some difficulty remembering things over the past year. In the\n      subsample composed of individuals aged 85+, this figure increased to 62%.\n\n      While some experiences of forgetting can be partially explained by age-related cognitive\n      decline, problems with retrieval processes can be attributed to a host of other factors\n      including stress and anxiety, lack of sleep, and side effects from medications. Even with all\n      of these other possible aspects at play, older adults tend to attribute everyday instances of\n      forgetting to uncontrollable factors including age. Moreover, while society tends to\n      associate forgetting with the elderly population, young adults also report the experience of\n      forgetting. There is reason to suspect that while older adults tend to experience more\n      instances of forgetting than they did as younger adults, they also pay more attention to\n      instances of forgetting, gathering evidence that they are declining. Every instance of\n      forgetting can confirm that one is in the midst of decline. This process is a type of\n      confirmation bias: Every time an older adult notices an instance of forgetting, he/she\n      confirms that the self fits within the larger negative age stereotype. The present study\n      investigates the Attention to Variability Paradigm. Specifically the participants will pay\n      attention to how memory performance fluctuates throughout the day.

The\n      patients always present with various cerebrovascular diseases, cognitive impairment and\n      sensorimotor abnormalities, with morbidity over 40%. However, the risk factors and the neural\n      mechanisms of brain injury in ESRD is still unclear. Identifying the risk factors and finding\n      objective and reliable biomarkers of brain impairment in the process of ESRD is an important\n      clinical problem. At the same time, to find the neural mechanisms of brain damage in ESRD is\n      a serious scientific problem. Neuroimaging techniques based on multi-modal magnetic resonance\n      image (MRI) can detect the structural and functional brain abnormalities objectively and\n      sensitively, especially for those without obvious clinical symptoms. Through the deep\n      analysis of brain MRI data, it is helpful for studying the neural mechanisms of brain damage\n      in ESRD in the perspective from brain science. In addition, the accumulation of uremic toxins\n      is supposed to play an essential role in the brain impairment of ESRD.
